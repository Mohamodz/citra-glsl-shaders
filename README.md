# citra-glsl-shaders
Some modified glsl shaders for use with Citra.  
  
Installation  
To use with citra, install the files from the working folder to Citra user folder /shaders. For instance, if using the portable setup it will be :  
canary-mingw/user/shaders  
On a default windows install, the folder would be : C:/Users/[your-user-name]/AppData/Roaming/Citra/User/shaders
The shaders folder may need to be created.  

  Most of the shaders are ported from various sources for dolphin. https://forums.dolphin-emu.org/Thread-pack-of-ported-shaders and Hyllian's work on Ishiiruka.
