# citra-glsl-shaders
Some modified glsl shaders for use with Citra
To use with citra, install the files from the working folder to Citra user folder /shaders. For instance, if using the portable setup it will be : 
canary-mingw/user/shaders
On a default windows install, the folder would be : C:/Users/[your-user-name]/AppData/Roaming/Citra/User/shaders
The shaders folder may need to be created.
